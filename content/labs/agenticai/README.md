## Requirements

Ensure the following requirements are met in order to run this exercise:

- [ ] Name of the Impala Data Warehouse assigned to your user
- [ ] Name of Data Vizualization Cluster assigned to your user
- [ ] Cloudera AI models deployed as part of [Lab 4 - Cloudera AI](../lab4-cai/README.md)

!!! info
    The workshop instructor will assign your user to a Data Warehouse and Data Vizualisation cluster.

## Tasks

### Open Cloudera Data Vizualization in Data Warehouse

From the Cloudera on cloud Tenant home page, click on Data Warehouse.

![Cloudera on Cloud Tenant Home](cloudera_on_cloud_tenant_home.png)

In the pop up window that appears, click on **Manage Data Warehouse** to open the Data Warehouse Home page.

![Cloudera on Cloud Tenant Home](cloudera_on_cloud_tenant_home_cdw.png)

The Data Warehouse Home shows the deployed database catalogs, and virtual warehouses and allows access to data vizualization clusters.

Click on **Data Vizualization** from the left menu.

![Cloudera Data Warehouse](cdw_home_page.png)

In Data Visualization, click on the **Data Viz** button for the cluster instance your user was assigned.

### Add Field to Data Vizualization Dataset

Edit the previously created Dataset, in **Data** -> **`USERNAME`.telco_data_curated**.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 1](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step1.png)

Once in the Dataset, go to **Fields** in the left menu and then click on **EDIT FIELDS** to edit the fields of your dataset.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 2](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step2.png)

In the list of **Dimensions**, click the down arrow of the last field in the list, and select the option **Clone**.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 3](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step3.png)

Once the field is cloned, click on the pencil next to the field to edit it.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 4](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step4.png)

In the popup window that appears, enter the name of the new field in **Display Name**. We suggest that you enter `ChurnScore`.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 5](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step5.png)

Go to the **Expression** tab and enter the following value in the Expression field. This will allow you to call the REST API of the Model you have previously deployed.

```json
cviz_rest('{"url":"<url_workspace>","accessKey":"<access_key>","colnames":["monthlycharges","totalcharges","tenure","gender","dependents","onlinesecurity","multiplelines","internetservice","seniorcitizen","techsupport","contract","streamingmovies","deviceprotection","paymentmethod","streamingtv","phoneservice","paperlessbilling","partner","onlinebackup"],"response_colname":"result"}')
```

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 6](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step6.png)

We will now get values for the `<url_workspace>` and `<access_key>` placeholders from our deployed model in Cloudera AI.

### Retrieve Field Details from Cloudera AI model

Open Cloudera AI in tab of the web browser. Open the Project that you created in [Lab 4 - Cloudera AI](../lab4-cai/README.md).

Go to the section of Models of your project, and click on the Model that begins with the name _ModelViz_, followed by your assigned username.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 7](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step7.png)

In the Overview tab, copy the **URL** that allows you to interact and call the workspace API.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 8](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step8.png)

In Data Vizualization, replace the copied Workspace API value in the placeholder attribute `<url_workspace>` of the Expression field.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 9](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step9.png)

Returning to Cloudera AI, copy the **accessKey** of the model.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 10](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step10.png)

In Data Vizualization, replace the copied value in the placeholder attribute `<access_key>` of the Expression field.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 11](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step11.png)

Finish the process by clicking the **Validate Expression** button below the expression window.

If the message appears in green _Validation Successful_, Click on **Apply** to save the settings made.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 12](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step12.png)

The new field should appear in the list of fields. Change the data type, selecting the type _Integer_, which is represented by the symbol **#**.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 13](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step13.png)

Finish the process by clicking on the green **SAVE** button in the top menu.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 14](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step14.png)

### Add Real Time Model Visual to Dashboard

Return to the dashboard by selecting the option **VISUALS** from the top menu, and clicking on the name of the dashboard that was previously created.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 15](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step15.png)

Once in the dashboard, click on the button **Edit** which is in the upper left.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 16](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step16.png)

Edit the lower table by clicking on it and then on the **Build** button from the right vertical menu. Add the new field, **ChurnScore**, at the beginning of the table, by clicking and dragging from the option **Dimensions** available.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard CML Field Step 17](cdw_dv_cml_dashboard_step17.png)

Click on the **REFRESH VISUAL** button to update the table.

The new column, ChurnScore, should appear at the beginning of the table, with a value of numeric type.

Finish the process of updating the dashboard by clicking the button **SAVE** from the top left menu.
