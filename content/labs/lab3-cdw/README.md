## Requirements

Ensure the following requirements are met in order to run this exercise:

- [ ] Name of the Impala Data Warehouse assigned to your user
- [ ] Name of Data Vizualization Cluster assigned to your user

!!! info
    The workshop instructor will assign your user to a Data Warehouse and Data Vizualisation cluster.

## Tasks

### Open Cloudera Data Warehouse

From the Cloudera on cloud Tenant home page, click on Data Warehouse.

![Cloudera on Cloud Tenant Home](cloudera_on_cloud_tenant_home.png)

In the pop up window that appears, click on **Manage Data Warehouse** to open the Data Warehouse Home page.

![Cloudera on Cloud Tenant Home](cloudera_on_cloud_tenant_home_cdw.png)

The Data Warehouse Home shows the deployed database catalogs, and virtual warehouses and allows access to data vizualization clusters.

### Data Exploration with Impala Virtual Warehouse

In the Data Warehouse Overview page, click on the **Virtual Warehouses** tab.

![Cloudera Data Warehouse Open Virtual Warehouse](cdw_vw_home_page.png)

Select the Impala Virtual Warehouse instace your user was assigned and click the **Cloudera Data Explorer** app

#### Basic Data Exploration

Start with simple queries to understand the dataset's structure and contents.

!!! important
    In the below queries, the name of the database will be your workload username.

View the schema and first few rows to get a quick overview of the columns and data types.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM telcodb.telco_data_curated 
LIMIT 10;
```

![Cloudera Data Warehouse Query 1](cdw_vw_query_1.png)

Count the total number of rows to understand the size of the dataset.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM telcodb.telco_data_curated;
```

![Cloudera Data Warehouse Query 2](cdw_vw_query_2.png)

Examine the distribution of key categorical columns like `gender` and the target variable `Churn` to see the balance of the data.

```sql
SELECT Churn, COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM telcodb.telco_data_curated 
GROUP BY Churn;
```

![Cloudera Data Warehouse Query 3](cdw_vw_query_3.png)

#### Understanding Churn Drivers

These queries help identify potential factors influencing customer churn by calculating churn rates for various features.

Calculate churn rate by contract type to determine if a customer's contract length is a strong predictor of churn. The query below will likely show a higher churn rate for month-to-month contracts.

```sql
SELECT
  Contract,
  COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned_customers,
  CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS DOUBLE) / COUNT(*) AS churn_rate
FROM telcodb.telco_data_curated
GROUP BY Contract
ORDER BY churn_rate DESC;
```

![Cloudera Data Warehouse Query 4](cdw_vw_query_4.png)

Compare average monthly and total charges for churned versus non-churned customers to see if spending habits correlate with churn.

```sql
SELECT
  Churn,
  AVG(CAST(MonthlyCharges AS DOUBLE)) AS avg_monthly_charges,
  AVG(CAST(TotalCharges AS DOUBLE)) AS avg_total_charges
FROM telcodb.telco_data_curated
GROUP BY Churn;
```

![Cloudera Data Warehouse Query 5](cdw_vw_query_5.png)

Analyze churn rate by customer tenure by grouping customers into tenure bins. This helps visualize if newer customers churn more frequently.

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN CAST(tenure AS INT) <= 12 THEN '0-12 months'
    WHEN CAST(tenure AS INT) > 12 AND CAST(tenure AS INT) <= 24 THEN '13-24 months'
    WHEN CAST(tenure AS INT) > 24 AND CAST(tenure AS INT) <= 48 THEN '25-48 months'
    WHEN CAST(tenure AS INT) > 48 THEN '49+ months'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
  END AS tenure_group,
  COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned_customers,
  CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS DOUBLE) / COUNT(*) AS churn_rate
FROM telcodb.telco_data_curated
GROUP BY
  CASE
    WHEN CAST(tenure AS INT) <= 12 THEN '0-12 months'
    WHEN CAST(tenure AS INT) > 12 AND CAST(tenure AS INT) <= 24 THEN '13-24 months'
    WHEN CAST(tenure AS INT) > 24 AND CAST(tenure AS INT) <= 48 THEN '25-48 months'
    WHEN CAST(tenure AS INT) > 48 THEN '49+ months'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
  END
ORDER BY tenure_group;
```

### Cloudera Data Vizualization

Return to the Data Warehouse Overview page and click on **Data Vizualization** from the left menu.

![Cloudera Data Warehouse](cdw_home_page.png)

In Data Visualization, click on the **Data Viz** button for the cluster instance your user was assigned.

![CDW Open Data Viz](cdw_open_data_viz.png)

#### Create a Dataset in Data Vizualization

Once in Data Visualization, go to the **Data** option from the top menu, and then to the Connector of the form _viz-impala-cxn-00N_ from the left menu.

![CDW Data Viz Connectors](cdw_dv_connectors.png)

We have to create a new data source, for that, click on **New Dataset**. A window will
appear to enter the information of the new data source.

![CDW Data Viz New Dataset](cdw_dv_new_dataset.png)

Enter the information for the new data source as follows:

- **Dataset title**: Use the naming convention `USERNAME.telco_curated_data`
- **Dataset Source**: Select `From table`
- **Select Database**: Enter your Workload Username, `USERNAME`
- **Select Table**: Select `telco_data_curated`

Click on **CREATE** to create the new Dataset.

![CDW Data Viz Create New Dataset](cdw_dv_create_new_dataset.png)

#### Explore Dataset in Data Vizualization

The new Dataset should appear in the list. Click on the dataset that you just created.

![CDW Data Viz Open New Dataset](cdw_dv_open_new_dataset.png)

Here you will see the details of the dataset.

![CDW Data Viz New Dataset Details](cdw_dv_new_dataset_details.png)

Click on **Fields** (left menu) to see the fields automatically captured during the dataset creation
process.

![CDW Data Viz Dataset Fields](cdw_dv_dataset_fields.png)

You can also preview the data from this screen. Click on **Data Model** (left menu) and then on the button **Show Data** that appears in the center.

![CDW Data Viz Dataset Preview Data](cdw_dv_dataset_preview_data.png)

At this moment, a query to the Virtual Warehouse is executed to retrieve the data from the data set. This may take 1-2 minutes to complete. Once loaded, notice the columns and values.

![CDW Data Viz Dataset Preview Data View](cdw_dv_dataset_preview_data_view.png)

#### Create Data Vizualization Dashboard

Click **New Dashboard** to create a new dashboard.

![CDW Data Viz Create New Dashboard](cdw_dv_create_new_dashboard.png)

When opening the design canvas of a new panel, remove the element that is added by default, by clicking on the three dots (`...`) button at the top right of the element, and then clicking on the option **Delete Visual**

![CDW Data Viz New Dashboard](cdw_dv_new_dashboard.png)

At the top of the canvas, in the enter title field, enter the name `Churn Analysis` to identify the dashboard.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard Step 1](cdw_dv_dashboard_step1.png)

To add a new visual element, click on the button **Visuals** from the right menu, select the dataset that corresponds to them, and click on the button **New Visual**.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard Step 2](cdw_dv_dashboard_step2.png)

Add the first visual element, which is a Pie Chart with the Dimensions **churn** and **contract**, with the Measures of **Record count**. Once finished, click the button **Refresh Visual**. Set the title of the visual to `Churn by type of contract`.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard Step 3](cdw_dv_dashboard_step3.png)

Add the second visual element, which is a Scatter Chart with the dimension **partner** as X Axis, **gender** as Y Axis, **dependents** as Colors and **avg (total charges)** as Size. Once finished, click the button **Refresh Visual**. Set the title of the visual to `Churn by family`.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard Step 4](cdw_dv_dashboard_step4.png)

Add the third visual element, which is a Bar Chart with the dimensions **streamingtv** and **streamingmovies** as X Axis, **Record Count** as Y Axis and **churn** as Colors. Once finished, click the button **Refresh Visual**. Set the title of the visual to `Churn by service`.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard Step 5](cdw_dv_dashboard_step5.png)

Add the fourth and last visual element, which is a table with the dimensions and metrics of the dataset. Be sure to add all 18 dimensions and 3 metrics (do not use Record Count) to the table. Once finished, click the button **Refresh Visual**. Set the title of the table to `Scoring - Churn Probability`.

![CDW Data Viz Dashboard Step 6](cdw_dv_dashboard_step6.png)

Save the dashboard by clicking the button **Save** from the top menu.

**End of Lab 3**
